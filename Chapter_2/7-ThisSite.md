# This Site
This site is built off of the Moodle open source education platform. I chose it because it allows me the most flexibility and control over the experience I present. 

The platform allows the submission and grading of assignments, which to me is an essential part of learning. The act of creating with knowledge cements understanding in  a way that studying never can. But, I have to be honest here, I don't grade the assignments. With a couple thousand students, it is just a ton of work I don't have the time for.  

I ask you to please treat each assignment as something that can and will be graded, because it will force you to do a good job. Some students have taken their responses to homeworks and directly placed them on their blogs, as the content you will be creating should be that high of quality. 

A lot of the material across these courses is repeated. If you are back to a section you've done before, just skip it. No need to waste your time if you don't want a refresher. 

If you need feedback on your assignments, DM me on Slack with your name and the assignment and I'll read it over and get back to you.

Thank you for your understanding!
