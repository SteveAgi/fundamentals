# Modern IDE

IDEs or Integrated Development Environments are tools with the ability
to run and debug code, as well as write it. They often have deep
integrations meant to make you more productive, like code completion and
syntax highlighting.

Plenty of text editors, including vim and emacs, have functionality
named "plugins". Plugins are software that can be added to existing tool
to extend what they are able to do. For these text-editors, the plugins
are used to add helpful tools that makes it easier to write code fast
and well.

I used to recommend people turn vim into a mostly fully featured IDE,
using a fancy shmanch .vimrc file. This dotfile, similar to the .bashrc
you made in the last section, is used to configure vim on startup. Alas,
I no longer believe in using vim as an IDE.

Instead of configuring vim to do a lot of things it was never meant to
do, just install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener"

awesome and you can install all sorts of great syntax checkers and
auto-completer extensions for your favorite languages.

For your assignment, install VS Code for Linux.
