# Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Github is pretty awesome, but somehow, they just keep doing more and
more for us. One really awesome thing they do is called Github pages,
where they will build and host a website for us if we put all the code
into the correct Github repo. The way that actually works is pretty
complicated, but from our perspective, it's just a magic personal
website, for free!

As a matter of fact,
<a href="https://hoppersroppers.org/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">https://hoppersroppers.org</a> is run off Github pages
and is actually
<a href="https://hoppersroppers.github.io/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">https://hoppersroppers.github.io</a>! Pretty cool eh?

Using the
<a href="https://github.com/hoppersroppers/demoHtml" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">demoHtml</a> repo you forked off in the first git
assignment, <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">convert it to a Github pages site using
this guide</a>.

Notably you will have to change the name of the repo to your username on
Github for this to work properly, but there are a few other little
things I am confident that you will be able to figure out.

On that same note, you'll be able to figure this out. I'm not going to
give you an HTML tutorial. Think of it like the Regex section, this is
for appreciation, not understanding. I want you to trial and error it,
google things, find code snippets, and just make something that makes
you happy. Make that site your own!

My favorite student made site so far <a
href="https://mrashleyball.github.io/Roppers-Computing-Fundamentals-Build-a-Website-with-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">was this one</a> by Mr. Ashley Ball. I
think it does a better job teaching than most tutorials.

Your requirements for this site are:

1.  Have a solid color background
2.  Have at least one image
3.  Have at least one hyperlink
4.  Have at least one snippet of Javascript that adds an OnClick event.

5.  Use CSS to make your font look pretty!

Feel free to make it as complicated or basic as you would like, and have
fun playing around with it. I recommend this site:

Web development is an incredibly massive field and I don't plan to teach
you here. This is just meant to be enough for you to slightly understand
how it works and get an appreciation for the hard work that goes into
beautiful websites.

Plus, now you have a way to show your work to friends and family!

1.  Submit a link to your github.io site.
2.  Explain what the OnClick event does and how it works.
