Visit this [man-page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash) and write down the first three things you don?t understand.?(I don't expect you to make it past the Name, "bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell", there is so much to unpack in just that).

Then Google one of them and figure out what it is. For the love of everything, don?t read any further once you are done with that. Remember Rule 3 of the Hacker Attitude, ?Boredom and Drudgery are evil.? If you're not getting anything out of something at any point in this course, don't do it, and leave us feedback that we are wasting your time. We mean that. You won't hurt our feelings.
