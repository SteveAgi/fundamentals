# Questions

Alright, you probably didn't expect this line of questioning in this
course, and yet, here we are. Serious business time, three quick
questions:

1.  Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and
    not wake up?

2.  Have you actually had any thoughts about killing yourself? If so,
    have you thought about how you might do this?

3.  In the past three months, have you done anything, started to do
    anything, or prepared to do anything to end your life?

If you are in the US and answered yes to any of these questions, visit

If you are in the US, Canada, UK, or Ireland and you would prefer to
text rather than talk on the phone, the Crisis Text Line
<a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/text-us/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank">https://www.crisistextline.org/text-us/</a> provides
free, anonymous, 24/7 support.

If you are international, check out this website

or search for resources online, they are available to you.

If you don't want to talk to a stranger, my name is Dennis, email me at
d.m.devey@gmail.com or hit me in Slack.

It's okay to not be okay, talk to someone.
