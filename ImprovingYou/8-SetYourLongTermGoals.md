The most important thing you can do to increase your ability at a chosen task is to trust the process and put the time in. After that, studies show that one of the most important things you can do to increase your chances of success are to decide on, verbalize, and record your goals and the things you are doing to attain them.

The majority of people who take this course do it to be better at computing and security fundamentals. Oftentimes this in pursuit of becoming a cyber security professional, but often times people just want to learn and see what the options are.

To flesh those ideas out, put some time into your goals.

1. What are your goals for taking this course?
2. What are your long term goals in the fields of security and computing?

If you want to submit those you can, but if if you don't know yet, or don't feel comfortable submitting them, that is completely understandable. You will also get credit for this section by submitting "Why are you asking personal questions about me internet stranger?" 

The answer is because I want you to think about it, and forcing you to type something out makes you really think about it. Kind of the philosophy for the entire course. 

***NOTE: You will not be able to submit anything if you are not logged in/have not registered for the course yet. [Click here to register](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/login/index.php)!***
