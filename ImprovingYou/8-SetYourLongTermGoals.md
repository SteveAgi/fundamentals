The most important thing you can do to increase your ability at a chosen
task is to trust the process and put the time in. After that, studies
show that one of the most important things you can do to increase your
chances of success are to decide on, verbalize, and record your goals
and the things you are doing to attain them.

The majority of people who take this course do it to be better at
computing and security fundamentals. Oftentimes this in pursuit of
becoming a cyber security professional, but often times people just want
to learn and see what the options are.

To flesh those ideas out, put some time into your goals.

1.  What are your goals for taking this course and what are your long
    term goals in the fields of computing and/or security?

If you want to submit those you can, but if if you don't know yet, or
don't feel comfortable submitting them, that is completely
understandable. You will also get credit for this section by submitting
"Why are you asking personal questions about me internet stranger?"

The answer is because I want you to think about it, and forcing you to
type something out makes you really think about it. Kind of the
philosophy for the entire course.
