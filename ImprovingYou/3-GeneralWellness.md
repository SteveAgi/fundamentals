Alright, forget about computers for a second, you only get one body and
there are some pretty straightforward things you can build into habits
to help future you out. Your behavior is the sum of your habits. Do the
hard things and take care of yourself.

#### Hydrate Constantly

-   My life motto is "Stay Happy and Stay Hydrated", and it is inscribed
    in my class ring... so yeah, I take hydration seriously
-   Trying to say how much water you should drink is too variable, you
    should be going to the bathroom every 2-4 hours
-   Caffeine and alcohol, and especially drinks like coffee and energy
    drinks dehydrate you
-   Hydration is slightly more complicated than water in/water out.
    Electrolytes are what actually provide hydration, so you basically
    can't go wrong adding extra electrolytes to your water. 

#### Sleep

-   Everyone loves bragging about being a badass and sleeping four hours
    a night for months on end... guess what? It's not just stupid, it's
    actively hurting you in a variety of ways. Plus it doesn't make
    anyone think you are cool
-   Sleep for seven or more hours a night if you can and <a

    rel="noopener" target="_blank">basically everything</a> improves

#### Nutrition

-   You and I know exactly what we are supposed to do, we just don't do
    it all the time
-   Don't worry about specific diets, if you avoid drinking your
    calories (beer, soda, sugary drinks, etc) and eating processed foods
    (cheetos, hot pockets, pizza etc) you will be fine
-   Cook your own food as much as possible, if only to be conscious of
    what you are putting in your body. Cooking is fun as hell and
    cheaper. Do it.
    -   Instant ramen doesn't count (but is delicious, and not too bad
        for you if you throw eggs in

#### Fitness

-   Not going to beat this one to death. Getting your heart rate
    elevated for a few minutes a day is good for you, full stop. Do it.
-   Much like what I said about learning new things, you must work
    deliberately to improve. Working out 3x a week will put future you
    in a much better place than if you don't do it at all.

#### Neurodiversity

Our brains let us do amazing things, and the hacker community is known
for our neurodiversity. Here are some resources to help understand what
you or other people experience every day.

#### Mental Health 

The more you know about these health concerns and their symptoms, the
better you can understand them. Additionally, everyone needs more
general suicide prevention and depression training. It's not fun, but it
is worth having all the resources you can. Read all of these. Help
yourself or help your friends.
