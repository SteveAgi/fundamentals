##  If you're going to be working through this course, competing in a Capture the Flag (CTF), or just binging Netflix because you deserve it, these are a few changes you can put into your life that will make you a happier and healthier person.

## Ergonomics

We spend too much time in front of our computers, and over a long enough
period of time, this can have negative effects on our bodies. We will
summarize this [quick
guide](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169)
to get you set up right.

-   Monitor
    -   We want our monitors to be at an arms distance away, right at
        eye level
    -   This forces our necks to be up and our backs to not hunch
    -   Your monitor likely needs to be raised up on books to get to the
        right height

-   Chair:
    -   Set your chair at a height where your feet are flat on the
        ground
    -   Adjust armrests so that your elbows and forearms are parallel to
        the ground
    -   This will require your keyboard to be at the same level as your
        chair, which often requires and under desk tray

-   Mouse Use

    -   When using a mouse, keep on the same level as your keyboard and
        keep forearms straight
    -   Overall you want to minimize use and learn to use the keyboard,
        mostly so you look cool

-   Laptops

    -   Laptops are terrible for ergonomics because of the monitor and
        keyboard being so close together
    -   The cheapest answer is to buy a USB keyboard/mouse so you can
        raise the monitor on a stack of books or similar items and have
        the keyboard at the appropriate level
        -   This is what I work off of the majority of the time.
    -   Sitting on a couch or in bed with a laptop is about the worst
        thing you can do for your back. If you are doing serious work,
        get to a desk with an appropriate setup

Now fix your setup so that everything aligns properly. This is an
investment in yourself.

## Hardware Required

While we are on the subject of investments ***YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUY A
NEW COMPUTER***. My daily driver is a 8 year old Dell brick. There are
students who have done this course on a Raspberry Pi. A significant
number of students do it on an Android phone. While we all want a tower
of hardware with six monitors and a light up keyboard, knowledge doesn't
care what you are on, it just cares that you are putting in the work.

## Blue Light and Brightness

-   Are you used to your eyes hurting after too long on the computer?
     Drop the brightness on your computer as far as you can. Just trust
    me.

-   Blue light is slightly more complicated and while scientists don't
    all agree about the effects on eyesight, they're pretty confident
    about impact on sleep cycles.

    -   Windows 10has a built in [Blue Light
        Filter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-10-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136)
    -   Mac has [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513)
    -   If you are on Linux use [this
        link](https://itsfoss.com/night-shift-flux-ubuntu-linux/) to
        find a method you're comfortable with.
    -   If you are on an old version of Windows that doesn't have it
        yet, just update to Windows 10 please.
    -   If you are a crazy person like me, go into the monitor settings
        and change the Red/Blue/Green distribution of the display. That
        way you can really take care of your eyes, but all the colors
        will be wacky.

-   It is also an option to get blue light filtering glasses if you have
    money to blow, they're definitely not needed. If you want them, you
    should buy a pair from
    [Blenders](https://www.blenderseyewear.com/collections/blue-light).
    I'm not sponsored, but I used to live next to them and they're a
    chill team so they deserve money.

    -   If we're really being honest, you can get cheap pairs from
        Amazon and they'll be like 1/5 the price and do basically the
        same thing.
