If you're going to be working through this course, competing in a Capture the Flag (CTF), or just binging Netflix because you deserve it, these are a few changes you can put into your life that will make you a happier and healthier person.

## Ergonomics
We spend too much time in front of our computers, and over a long enough period of time, this can have negative effects on our bodies. We will summarize this [quick guide](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169) to get you set up right.

* Monitor
  * We want our monitors to be at an arms distance away, right at eye level
    * This forces our necks to be up and our backs to not hunch
    * Your monitor likely needs to be raised up on books to get to the right height
* Chair:
  * Set your chair at a height where your feet are flat on the ground
  * Adjust armrests so that your elbows and forearms are parallel to the ground
    * This will require your keyboard to be at the same level as your chair, which often requires and under desk tray
* Mouse Use
  * When using a mouse, keep on the same level as your keyboard and keep forearms straight
  * Overall you want to minimize use and learn to use the keyboard, mostly so you look cool

* Laptops
  * Laptops are terrible for ergonomics because of the monitor and keyboard being so close together
    * The cheapest answer is to buy a USB keyboard/mouse so you can raise the monitor on a stack of books or similar items and have the keyboard at the appropriate level
       * This is what I work off of the majority of the time. 
  * Sitting on a couch or in bed with a laptop is about the worst thing you can do for your back. If you are doing serious work, get to a desk with an appropriate setup

Now fix your setup so that everything aligns properly. This is an investment in yourself.

## Hardware Required

While we are on the subject of investments ***YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUY A NEW COMPUTER***. My daily driver is a 8 year old Dell brick. There are students who have done this course on a Raspberry Pi. A significant number of students do it on an Android phone. While we all want a tower of hardware with six monitors and a light up keyboard, knowledge doesn't care what you are on, it just cares that you are putting in the work.

## Blue Light and Brightness
* Drop the brightness on your computer as far as you can. Just trust me.

* Are you used to your eyes hurting after too long on the computer? This is mostly from the blue light. There's a ton of research you can read to prove it, or you can turn it on.
   * Windows 10 [Blue Light Filter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-10-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136)
   * Mac [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513)
   * If you are on Linux use [this link](https://itsfoss.com/night-shift-flux-ubuntu-linux/) to find a method you're comfortable with.
   * If you are on an old version of Windows that doesn't have it yet, just update to Windows 10 please.
   * If you are a crazy person like me, go into the monitor settings and change the Red/Blue/Green distribution of the display. That way you can really take care of your eyes, but all the colors will be wacky. 
 
* It is also an option to get blue light filtering glasses if you have money to blow. You should buy a pair from [Blenders](https://www.blenderseyewear.com/collections/blue-light). I'm not sponsored, but I used to live next to them and they're a chill team so they deserve money.
   * If we're really being honest, you can get cheap pairs from Amazon and they'll be like 1/5 the price and do basically the same thing.

## Dark Mode

I'm sorry, but I'm not a good web developer. HTML and CSS are as hard (or harder) as anything out there. Despite everyone asking for a dark mode (so they can feel like a cool hacker), I don't plan on implementing one with my current skillset. My solution is to tell you to install a dark mode extension for your browser if you want dark modes. I use <https://mybrowseraddon.com/dark-mode.html>. It doesn't work perfectly, but it is easier on the eyes, and you can use it for all websites, not just Roppers. I recommend you use option "blue dark", 10 down on class A of general dark styles. Hopefully y'all aren't here for my web design skills.
