It's time for you to find the group of students you will be working
through this course with! 

Science, and my experience running this course, show that students who
work together --- finish together. 

If you have found three or more students already, good! Start that group
chat and get to know each other! 

If you are still looking for partners, reach out in \#findapartner on
Slack and get the gang together!

You can also ask your friends in real life or social media if they want
to join you on this journey. Real world partners are even more effective
to hold you accountable! Plus getting your group of friends into tech
would be pretty sweet. 

If you want to work through this by yourself/don't feel like finding
partners, I get it. Just keep working through the course and don't worry
about it, you just gotta promise to reach out when you need help.

  

## Different Languages

Roppers tries its best to be welcoming to people from all countries and
backgrounds, but we are primarily English speaking. I wish I knew
another language, but turns out seven years of a dead language like
Latin is not particularly useful in the real world. 

Our Slack has multiple channels for different world languages. I'll make
new ones on request, so reach out if you want your language represented.

-   \#roppers-espanol
-   \#roppers-francais
-   \#roppers-italiano
-   \#roppers-deutsch
