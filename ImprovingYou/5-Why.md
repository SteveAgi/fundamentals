# Why
You thought you were here to learn how to get better at computers, so what is all this?

Well, hopefully your end goal in life is that you become a better person and have a better life. If you want to be good at computers just for the sake of being good at computers that counts for something, but to me, all this technology is just a way for me to accomplish more than I could by myself.

If you're going to be doing anything in this world, might as well take care of yourself first. Learning security comes far after you and your well-being.

Now, on to the show!
