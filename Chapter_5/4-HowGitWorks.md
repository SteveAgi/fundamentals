# How Git Works
You worked through using GitHub for the last assignment but probably don't feel comfortable with how it works. Oftentimes you can avoid understanding it and just fake it for a few years... I certainly did. 

Work through this resource up through the "Main" 'Ramping Up' section and take the time to try and understand what is going on: <https://learngitbranching.js.org/>. Don't worry about the sections past that in 'Main', as they are more advanced than you'll need right now. Once you're done in "Main", switch over to 'Remote' and complete " Push & Pull -- Git Remotes!"

When you are done with " Push & Pull -- Git Remotes!" submit a screenshot showing your completion. 

Don't worry about completely understanding this, just be able to think about it and whenever you need to, just use Google and look for tutorials and answers on what you're trying to do.
