# More Programming
If you want to learn Computer Science properly, I recommend you work through <https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/README.md>. It's a fairly comprehensive education. 

This is outside of the scope of this course, so I'd prefer if you stuck around, but the entire point of learning is following what you are interested in. No hard feelings if you go, just promise to come back! 

Recommend you start at this course, as you already have some python experience. <https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#introduction-to-programming>
