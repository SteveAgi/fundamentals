# Capstone Project and Get a Certificate
We generally know how to scrape a website now, and hopefully have a good feeling about our ability to program in Python.

For your capstone project, I want you to write a scraper that accesses academy.hoppersroppers.org, authenticates with your credentials, captures the token, and uses that token to download a copy of everything linked to from the Computing Fundamentals course page. Ensure that you never save your credentials to Github (Google how to make sure of that).

This is a complicated project and you will have to use Google, your existing code from Automate the Boring Stuff, and the #python channel in Slack. As you go along, we will be there to help you out!

Once you have it working, submit a link to your Github repo to d.m.devey@gmail.com and to the text box below (Again, make sure your credentials haven't been saved at any point)

Good luck!! When you are done, I'll send you the Ropper's Python certificate!
