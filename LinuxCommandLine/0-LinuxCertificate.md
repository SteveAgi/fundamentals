Welcome to the Linux section of the Ropper's Fundamentals course.

This is one of the longest sections, but I consider it the hump you need
to get over for you to go from being someone who wants to learn things
and someone who is really out there learning.

It's a lot of work, but it is worth it. Plus, in the end you get a
certificate!

Thanks for sticking around so far, let's go crush some Linux.
