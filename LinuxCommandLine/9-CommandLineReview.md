I believe deeply in an educational theory known as spaced repetition.
[This is the best article on
it](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition) but in short, the idea is
instead of introducing material once and hoping you remember it later,
the course creator designs in a variety of places where you will be
forced to recall the material you have previously learned. By spacing
this out over time, the connections in your brain get stronger and the
chances you retain the information significantly increases. 

In this course we are going to do this by answering some questions from
the previous couple sections. You might have the answers generally in
your mind, but I recommend you go back to the content, maybe do a quick
Google, and make sure your response covers what you need to answer the
questions I ask. 

Don't worry about knowing the answers now, but the next time you get
asked these, at the end of the next section, I bet you'll be a little
faster. 

1.  What is an operating system?
2.  Describe what an operating system is responsible for. Remember it is
    a trick question.
3.  What is UNIX-like?
4.  Who wrote UNIX?
5.  Describe the history of Linux.
6.  What is a shell? What is a GUI? What is a CLI?
7.  What are some resources to figure out what a command does?
8.  What is BASH? 
9.  Describe STDIO?

Don't worry about making these perfect, this is for you to learn!!

This assignment is optional, so if you don't want to do this, just think
about the answers and submit a file that says you are skipping this.
