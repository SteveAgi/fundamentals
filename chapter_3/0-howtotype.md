# How to Type

[Check out our free course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=741)

This is not required... but you should learn how to do it. 

This is an investment in your productivity, the faster you can type, the better your life will be. 

It is important to note that fast typing will not make you better at programming or at hacking.

It is commonly said that "typing is not the bottleneck". When you are working, it doesn't really matter how fast you type, because you won't be going faster than your brain.

However, this matters for everything else you will ever do on a computer, like writing, taking notes, and journaling. I'm still learning how to do this well. Writing is one of the most important skills you can have, no matter how technical you get.

1. Submit a screenshot of the completion for this, and work to continue doing this for the rest of your damn life.

I'll be honest. I don't do this. I have a very fast words per minute hunting and pecking with all fingers. My hands look like demented spiders when I type. It's not great. I know I should force myself and someday I will.
