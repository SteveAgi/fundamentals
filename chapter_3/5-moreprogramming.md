# More Programming

[Check out our free course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=1258)

If you want to get good at programming, you should go and complete all the exercises in Automate the Boring Stuff (<https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>) in Python 3. Once you have done that you will be capable of just about any scripting task in Python if you have the time to do your research and work through it.

If you want to learn Computer Science properly, I recommend you work through <https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/README.md>. It's a fairly comprehensive education. 

This is outside of the scope of this course, so I'd prefer if you stuck around, but the entire point of learning is following what you are interested in. No hard feelings if you go, just promise to come back! 

Recommend you start at this course, as you already have some python experience. <https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#introduction-to-programming>
