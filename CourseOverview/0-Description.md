# Course Description
Hey! [I'm Dennis](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/about.html), the person behind Hopper's Roppers. 

This is our introductory course, teaching everything, and I mean everything, that a student needs to know about computers to have a successful career in a technical field. More information can be found [here](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/course.html). 

This is the first course in our [roadmap](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/roadmap/) which is our way of guiding students towards the best resources available, instead of overloading them with options and list of websites. 

In this course you will learn the fundamentals of computing, and get all the skills you need to learn whatever else you come across in your journey. You will be confident in the Linux environment, and be able to know how things work well enough to effectively troubleshoot any problem you come across. We won't make you into a hacker, but we'll give you the tools you need. Also, you'll earn [a certificate that states you know enough to be considered dangerous](https://badgr.com/public/badges/OCgMVVYKT82mZZkDah6BBQ). 

This course is not security specific and will be just as useful for someone who wants to be a web developer or an AI engineer as someone who wants to do information security. The fundamentals don't change, and are what you need to know to be successful in any field, and that's all we teach you in this course. 

If you already know fundamentals, there's still a lot your can get from this course. If you are looking for a course with a focus on cyber security, check out our [Introduction to Security Fundamentals](https://hoppersroppers.org/courseSecurity.html). If you are already confident in Linux and with programming and want to jump to the fun stuff, check out our [Introduction to CTFs](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/courseCTF.html). 

If you're still reading and know you want to build the foundation for the rest of your career, you're at the right place!

Everybody asks for videos, but I don't find them very useful at all for teaching information. Students learn from doing, researching, and working towards solutions, not watching some guy in a Hawaiian shirt talk to them about computers. This is the only video that is in this course, and I don't intend on making any more, or re-filming it in higher quality. If you're looking for a video course with slick production quality, check out Cybrary or Udemy, but stick around long enough and you'll learn more here than you ever imagined. 
 
Thanks for joining us, see you around!
