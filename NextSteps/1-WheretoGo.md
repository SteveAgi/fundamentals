# Where to Go
If you have come this far, we believe you are ready for the next step in your journey. 

If you haven't yet, you should check out the [Security Fundamentals: Theory and Practice course]($@COURSEVIEWBYID*9@$). I think it is pretty awesome. 

The next technical course for you is to jump into the [Intro to Capture the Flags course]($@COURSEVIEWBYID*7@$), where you will learn about data manipulation, cryptography, file formats, and some basic forensics. 

If you want to focus on networking you can skip the Introduction to CTF course and head straight for [Learning Networking with CTFs]($@COURSEVIEWBYID*20@$). That course is in progress, but should be pretty decent. 


Don't stop your journey here, keep on moving!
