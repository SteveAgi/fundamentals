If you have come this far, we believe you are ready for the next step in
your journey.

If you haven't yet, you should check out the [Security Fundamentals:
Theory and Practice course](https://www.roppers.org/courses/security). I
think it is pretty awesome.

The next technical course for you is to jump into the [Intro to Capture
the Flags course](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/courseCTF.html), where
you will learn about data manipulation, cryptography, file formats, and
some basic forensics.

If you want to focus on networking you can skip the Introduction to CTF
course and head straight for [Learning Networking with
CTFs](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/course/view.php?id=20). That
course is in progress, but should be pretty decent (eventually). You can
teach yourself at least.Â 

Don't stop your journey here, keep on moving!
