# Networking 1
Networking is the darkest art... and you may become an expert. Eventually. But all things considered, you will not be, and do not need to be an expert all the time. You become an expert on things when you need to be, when you have a challenge or a job or for whatever reason you need to become one of the world's leading experts in some bit of minutiae. There are people out there who are network wizards who do it for a living. Then there is everybody else who has to relearn everything every time they go in depth. What we will teach you here is scraping the minimum knowledge required to not need to Google everything. You will still Google everything, but this lets you get into the mix faster and will let you bullshit your way through most things. At the end of the day, you will never not need reference material and guides to work with networks.
