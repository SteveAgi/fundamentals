### Tracking
* A famous quote about the internet is ?If a service is free, the product is you?. this applies from social media to news sites to free antivirus. Silicon Valley is built on advertising money, and they make their money targeting advertisements. The more targeted, the more money they can charge. It isn't always advertisments though. Anything can be  turned into a dataset from pictures of your face, your conversations, any behavioral feature, or things like what you buy and what malware you download.
     * Read how it works:

## Search Engines and Tracking
We just taught you about Google hacking, immediately followed by tracking.
Go to Google, search for "learn how to hack" and click on the UBlock symbols and look at how much tracking is going on at a single page.

Now go to <https://duckduckgo.com/> and search for "learn how to hack". Now click the Ghostery and UBlock extensions? You should notice a difference.

Duck Duck Go cares a lot about privacy. It doesn't have as good search results as Google, but they're not bad. Some people swear by it. Me, I don't really care about Google selling my soul for better advertising. Sorry internet purists. Use Duck Duck Go if you want to be more private, as well as any time Google's algorithms decide that the thing you are searching for is wrong and you should be searching for some slightly related topic that is in the news at the time and shares search terms.
