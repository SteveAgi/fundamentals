           * A few things were mentioned here that wind up being important in internet culture. First is BBS, or Bulletin Board Systems. In the early days of dial up internet, BBSs were where the hacking happened. The second notable mention is of the Cult of the Dead Cow, an early internet group that were known for hacktivism, as well as other various online activities. They pop up all the time and were an important part in shaping internet culture.
