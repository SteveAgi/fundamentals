# Introduction

This the text version of the Hopper's Roppers Introduction to Computing Fundamentals course. It is a self-paced curriculum that was made to help our students over the first big learning hurdles and finally have a path forward. Our material is intended to be accessible for a student with no prior knowledge, but is worthwhile for any seasoned expert to take so that they can learn more about the subjects they have never had to dive into. Graduates of this course should be confident that they are fully prepared to continue their education wherever it leads.
