Continue working through this entire guide and answering questions as you go.  <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/index.htm>. You will also need to use other resources, I recommend wikipedia, but there are plenty of other amazing resources out there on this topic. During this section, I highly recommend you chat up teachers in order to ask questions and get clarification.

12. What is processor management?
13. How does process scheduling work?
14. What is a driver?
15. What is device management?
16. What is file management?
17. What is an I/O operation? (Hint I/O stands for input/output)
18. What is an interrupt?

You're finally done! Operating systems are terrible, but they are so important to understand. I recommend taking a real course on it one day if you ever get into lower level programming. If not, don't worry about it.
