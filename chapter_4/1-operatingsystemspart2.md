Continue working through this entire guide and answering questions as you go.  <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/index.htm>. You will also need to use other resources, I recommend wikipedia, but there are plenty of other amazing resources out there on this topic. During this section, I highly recommend you chat up teachers in order to ask questions and get clarification.

7. What is "swapping"?
8. What is fragmentation?
9. What does de-fragmentation do? (Fun fact, modern operating systems will do this for you... just another thing abstracted away)
10. What is multi-programming in regard to CPU execution?
11. What is the difference between a program and a process?
