# Over the Wire: 10-15

Back to OverTheWire again!

You finished the first ten levels, time to go back for 10-15! Pay
attention to the "Commands you might need to solve this level", but
remember, you won't need all of them!

If you ever get stuck on anything for more than a half hour, message us
in \#techsupport and we will help you out! Don't worry, I have no
problems giving you very specific instructions to get to the next stage.
If your googling keeps popping up Bandit walkthroughs instead of
references, use the search operator -"bandit" to clean up the search
results.

As a hint, 12-13 is a miserable problem and requires guessing. I'll save
you from some guesswork. Did you know `xxd -r` exists? Don't say I never
did anything for you.

Good luck!!!!
