# Over the Wire Bandit 1015
Back to OverTheWire again! 

You finished the first ten levels, time to go back for 10-15!  Pay attention to the "Commands you might need to solve this level", but remember, you won't need all of them!

SSH into : ```ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit10```

With the password ```truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk```

If you ever get stuck on anything for more than a half hour, message us in #techsupport and we will help you out! Don't worry, I have no problems giving you very specific instructions to get to the next stage. If your googling keeps popping up Bandit walkthroughs instead of references, use the search operator -"bandit" to clean up the search results.

As a hint, 12-13 is a miserable problem and requires guessing. I'll save you from some guesswork. Did you know ```xxd -r``` exists? Don't say I never did anything for you.

Good luck!!!!
