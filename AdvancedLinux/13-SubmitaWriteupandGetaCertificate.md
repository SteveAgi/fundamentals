One of the best things about CTFs like Bandit is that you can follow
someone else's writeup and copy what they have done to solve it
yourself.

While this might seem like cheating, one of the main benefits of CTFs is
that you get exposed to different problem types and learn how to deal
with them. Learning how to solve a problem type you've never seen before
is a good skill, but it is better to start by learning all the common
problems first by following other peoples' writeups.

For this assignment, choose one of the problems you solved in Bandit and
do a writeup on how someone could replicate what you did, then submit
it! Once you've submitted it, email me a copy at d.m.devey@gmail.com and
I will send you back the Ropper's Linux Certificate!
