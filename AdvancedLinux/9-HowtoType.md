This is not required... but you should learn how to type with your fingers on the home keys. I'll be honest. I don't do this. I have a very fast words per minute hunting and pecking with all fingers. My hands look like demented spiders when I type. It's not great. I know I should force myself and someday I will.

This is an investment in your productivity, the faster you can type, the better your life will be. 

It is important to note that fast typing will not make you better at programming or at hacking.

It is commonly said that "typing is not the bottleneck". When you are working, it doesn't really matter how fast you type, because you won't be going faster than your brain. The only thing I find it helpful for is so I don't have to look at the keys when I'm copying something, which is slightly useful

However, this matters for everything else you will ever do on a computer, like writing, taking notes, and journaling. I'm still learning how to do this well. Writing is one of the most important skills you can have, no matter how technical you get. In a future edition of this course, I'll have a better section on soft skills.

1. If you want to learn how to use the home rows, submit a screenshot of the completion for this, and work to continue doing this for the rest of your damn life. If you don't want to do the home row thing and are dedicated to hunting and pecking like me, submit a screenshot of how fast your Words per Minute are to show off.
