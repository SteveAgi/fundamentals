# Bored Yet?

Alright, I'm gonna be honest. Doing all these Linux Journey assignments
can be super boring, and is a ton of hard work. If you want to split it
up and do some theory, I really recommend you check out our Intro. to
Security course.

It's a nice change from marching through Linux commands like this and
will give you a good base to apply the knowledge you learn in this
course to the real world.

If you think you have good momentum right now, just keep pushing!
