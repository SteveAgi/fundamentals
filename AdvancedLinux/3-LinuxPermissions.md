# Linux Permissions

Â 

Alright, we went over a little bit of this earlier, but let's dive into
permissions. Permissions ***are*** security, and is one of the most
important things that an OS provides.

We haven't put much time into it yet, but the OS basically segregates
user and root process privileges using something known as "Protection
Rings".

Even though rings 0-3 are shown, basically no major OSs use anything but
Ring 3, Userspace and Ring 0, Kernel Mode. This is enough separation of
powers for a level of protection to be given to the kernel by locking
off userspace programs from accessing critical kernel functions. A very
common misconception is that when you run as root, with `sudo` or
otherwise, you are running in Ring 0. Not true! You are still in Ring 3
as a userspace process, albeit as UID 0 which gives you 'root' powers as
granted by the configuration of the system. You will never transition to
Ring 0 without control of a kernel mode driver (which is wildly out of
scope of this course and 99.99% of jobs that require Linux).

Secure defaults and well-implemented permissions go a very long way
towards making your Linux experience as smooth as it is. Userspace is
all that really matters to us, so first, let's go over how permissions
are represented, whether it is for the root user, background daemons, or
everyday users.

# Basics

Run `ls -l` on a directory and look at the results. Should look
something like this:

``` default
drwxr-x--- 2 username groupname 4096 Jan 21 14:02 folder1 -rwxr-x--- 1 username groupname 15 Jan 21 14:02 file2
```

We went over this a bit earlier, but for old time's sake.

-   The first bit tells us what type of file it is
    -   "d" means directory
    -   "-" means normal file
    -   There are more options that can go here, but these are most of
        them
-   The next 9 bits are permissions bits
    -   This is what we are about to learn!!
-   The next bit, a number, tells us how many hard links there are to
    the file, but don't worry about it
-   The first name is the username who owns the file, in this case you
-   The second name is the group who owns the file. Unless you've set up
    a group already, this should also be your username
-   The next number is the file size in bytes
    -   Directories are always the same size, but individual files
        should be listed as the number of bytes that make them up
-   The next numbers should be the date and time last modified. These
    are not forensically accurate but are good enough to sort by
    timestamp.
-   Finally, the name of the file you are looking at the details of

With that reviewed, let's dive into permissions. What do we do with
these nine bits?

It's actually a sort of straightforward thing. The nine bits are split
into three triplets that represent the perms (the cool way to say
permission) for "User", "Group" and "Other".

> User Group Other rwx rwx rwx rwx r-- --- r-x --- ---

As you can see, these triplets are comprised of "r","w",and "x", which
stands for read, write, and execute. Read means to access the file and
read the bit stream, write means to modify the location in the drive,
and execute means to run the process (assuming the file is an
executable). The lack of permission to do one of those actions is
represented by "-". This is constant across most OSs.

User and Group are defined by the names we see to the right of the
permission bits when we run `ls -l`. So if we see:

``` default
-rwxrw--- 1 jimmy students 15 Jan 21 14:02 file2
```

This means that the user 'jimmy' has read, write, execute perms, while
the group 'students' only has read and write. Any user who is not in the
group 'students' has no permissions whatsoever, not even to read the
file.

We haven't made any groups in our VM yet, so most likely when you run
`ls` you see your name for both user and group. That makes sense, don't
worry about it.

# Modifying Permissions

Now things get fun, let's change some permissions around!

We use the command `chmod` and either "u" (for user), "g" (for group),
"o" (for others), or "a" (for all 3) to do this on Linux. It's fairly
straightforward, we either add ("+") or remove ("-") permissions with
"r", "w", and "x". Here are some examples.

``` default
$ chmod g+x file2 
> I bet you can guess what that does: 
add the executable bit to the group permission for file2. 
> Run ```ls -l``` again and you will see it has changed. 
$ chmod g-w directory2 
> Now we have removed the write bit for a directory2 for group. 
$ chmod a+x file2 > Now we have added the executable bit for everyone.
```

We can use `chmod` to modify any permission on the file we own, as long
as we have the permission to modify permissions. The most common use of
`chmod` is when you download a file from somewhere, it is not given
execute privs by default due to security policy. So anytime you find an
executable not executing, you should check a chmod.

If we want to change permissions on something we don't own, you're going
to need root access for that. Let's play around with changing ownership
of files before we do that. Again, you'll need root access to change
ownership.

``` default
$ sudo chown root file2
```

Now when we `ls -l` we see that file2 is owned by root. When the sudo
command is finished running we drop back into our normal permissions
(run `whoami` to check). If we try to change permissions now with
`chmod` we will get a permission denied error. However, using `sudo` we
can elevate privs again and `chmod` the permission around because we are
the owner. This works for a file owned by any user, if you are root you
can do what you want. It's good to be the king/queen.

Similar to `chown` is `chgrp` which, you guessed it, changes the group.
Basically the same usage as `chown`.

A final thing we can do is set something known as "the sticky bit".

``` default
$ chmod +t file2 $ chmod +t directory2
```

This "+t" sets a file or directory as not-deletable by anyone other than
the owner and root. This is great for shared folders.

# Bits and Permissions

Because of the magic of binary, if we have three bits, those bits can
range from "111" to "000" which represents 7-0. This allows us to
represent permissions as numbers as well.

-   The read bit is "4"
-   The write bit is "2"
-   The execute bit is "1"

With three triplets, now our permissions look like this:

``` default
111 111 100
```

This is actually what the computer sees, so congratulations on finally
getting inside the matrix. This is a big day!

Because we can add up the bits in binary, the "rwx" we were getting used
to can also be represented by "111", "421", or "7". Lost yet? Keep
thinking about this until it makes sense.

Now that you get it, this also allows us to set perms in chmod in a much
cooler way.

``` default
$ chmod 755 file2
```

Damn that looks way more hardcore, you're using binary in real life.
Look at you go. Adding up the bits lets us know which perms are on. All
perms for everybody is represented by "777" but you should avoid doing
that, it's the opposite of the Principle of Least Privilege.

You can also remove permissions by using lower numbers.

``` default
$ chmod 744 file2
```

There we just removed the execute bit for group and others.

Assignment:

Submit a brief explanation of what the sticky bit is and anything you
don't understand.
