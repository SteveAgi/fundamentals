# Submit a Writeup and Get a Certificate

One of the best things about CTFs like Bandit is that you can follow someone else's writeup and copy what they have done to solve it yourself. 

While this might seem like cheating, one of the main benefits of CTFs is that you get exposed to different problem types and learn how to deal with them. Learning how to solve a problem type you've never seen before is a good skill, but it is better to start by learning all the common problems first by following other peoples' writeups. 

For this assignment, choose one of the problems you solved in Bandit and do a writeup on how someone could replicate what you did, then submit it! Once you've submitted it, email me a copy at d.m.devey@gmail.com and I will send you back the Ropper's Linux Certificate!
