# Modern IDE

IDEs or Integrated Development Environments are tools with the ability to run and debug code, as well as write it. They often have deep integrations meant to make you more productive, like code completion and syntax highlighting. 

Plenty of text editors, including vim and emacs, have functionality named "plugins". Plugins are software that can be added to existing tool to extend what they are able to do. For these text-editors, the plugins are used to add helpful tools that makes it easier to write code fast and well. 

I used to recommend people turn vim into a mostly fully featured IDE, using a fancy shmanch .vimrc file. This dotfile, similar to the .bashrc you made in the last section, is used to configure vim on startup. Alas, I no longer believe in using vim as an IDE. 

Instead of configuring vim to do a lot of things it was never meant to do, just install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Linux. It is absolutely awesome and you can install all sorts of great syntax checkers and auto-completer extensions for your favorite languages.

For your assignment, install VS Code and submit a screenshot of your nice beautiful IDE, with an HTML Syntax highlighting extension installed.
