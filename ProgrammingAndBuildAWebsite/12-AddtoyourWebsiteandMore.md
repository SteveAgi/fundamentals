# Add to your Website and More
# Add Content 

Do you know what you should do right now? 

Take one of the assignments (or a few of them) you have already completed and turn it into a blog post. Then host that blog post on the website you created. 

Just a thought, no need to do it if you don't want to. 

If you do, tweet a link to the site and DM @HoppersRoppers so we can retweet you! 

# Register a Domain Name

If you think you're too cool for a .github.io domain name, go check out a domain registrar and think about buying a domain name to use. You can still use Github.io for hosting (I use it for HoppersRoppers.org!) 

I recommend NameCheap if you are going to do it. 

This is totally unnecessary, but it is interesting and you will learn quite a bit.
