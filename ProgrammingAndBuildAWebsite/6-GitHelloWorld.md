# Git Hello World
## Open Source
You might have heard of Open Source before, as there has been an infinite amount written about the subject, but this is a good place to learn about it. Open source and hacking go hand in hand. You might not feel strongly about it now, but you will eventually.

## Github
Github is an amazing website build around an old tool named 'git'. Git is used for version control during software development, allowing collaboration and the merging of changes in a safe and easy manner. It is used by just about everyone and is amazing. If you want to build large pieces of software, you need to use version control. Github is a website that wraps git and allows you to share your code via their website, as well as letting you download other people's code.

Github and git knowledge is basically required for any programmer job, so let's learn it before we start anything else.
