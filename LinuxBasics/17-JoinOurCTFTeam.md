# Join Our CTF Team!

You've made it far enough into our Fundamentals course that you are now
formally invited to the Roppers CTF team! 

We are named Hopper's Roppers and are a small crew of hackers who are
trying to get better and support each other. This is a very informal
thing, so don't worry about taking on a commitment.

We try to play every weekend, so if the competition is on CTF Time,
anyone can sound the call to arms and see who they can get to sign up.
There is no pressure to be there every weekend, or even every 6 months,
just show up when you can and contribute what you can. Everyone can
help!

Request to join our team here! <https://www.roppers.org/pages/ctf-team> 

In our Slack, check out the \#ctftime channel to join the party. Someone
there will direct you to the not-so-secret Roppers Discord.

  

Once you finish this course, check out our CTF course so you can get up
to speed quickly!
