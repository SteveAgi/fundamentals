If you ever get stuck on anything for more than a half hour, message us
in \#techsupport and we will help you out! Don't worry, I have no
problems giving you very specific instructions to get to the next stage.
If your googling keeps popping up Bandit walkthroughs instead of
references, use the search operator -"bandit" to clean up the search
results.

Good luck!!!!
