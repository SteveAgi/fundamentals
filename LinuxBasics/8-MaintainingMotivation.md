This section is a work in progress, but it breaks down to a few key
ideas:

1.  Motivation is about building routine and taking the mental effort
    out of doing the work, and making it mentally straining to not do
    the work. This is why building habits is so important.
2.  There are a lot of things that feel like you are working, but aren't
    really working
    -   Watching video courses because you don't have the mental
        capacity right now (guilty!)
    -   Scrolling Twitter (guilty!)
    -   Gathering resources and skimming papers for things to read more
        later (guiltyyyyyyy!!)
3.  Schedule your motivation and do not allow any distractions to occur
    during this time.

Alright now, time to keep going. Only thing that separates you from your
previous self is how much work you are willing to put in.
