# Installing Programs
## Personalize

Now that the VM is yours, it is time to personalize it. Going forward, I strongly recommend that you do everything in your Linux VM. That means your homework, checking your emails, listening to music, anything. The more time spent immersed the better off you will be.

Next I am going to have you install programs from a variety of sources. There is nothing in here that is for power users yet, this is just to help you make your VM habitable. Don't worry about typing in your password to install things on Linux. This is normal behavior anytime you use higher level permissions. If you have any problems, ask in #techsupport.


## Install Some applications

1. Install Gnome Tweak Tool from the command line and do something interesting
   * ```sudo apt-get install gnome-tweaks```
      * Remember this command?
   * As an interesting note, Gnome is the default GUI that comes with the Ubuntu OS, but that was not always the case. If you really wanted to, you could replace the Gnome GUI with a different GUI due to the open source nature of Linux OSs.
2. Install Google Chrome (or another browser) using a .deb file
  * .deb is the file extension for a Debian package, as Ubuntu operates under the Debian system. Any .deb file should work on Ubuntu.
  * If you're looking for a more lightweight browser try Chromium, and if you're into privacy, check out Brave. Both have .deb files

3. Install the art program GIMP via the 3rd party package manager FlatPak and make a meme!
  * There are many other 3rd party package managers, nothing special about FlatPak
  * When you are done making a meme, post your meme in Slack in the channel #course_computing.

As you can see, there is some surprising complexity in how we install files on Linux... but let's not worry about that too much yet. Hopefully this section gave you some confidence doing uncomfortable activities.
