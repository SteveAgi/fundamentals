If you ever get stuck on anything for more than a half hour, message us in #techsupport and we will help you out! Don't worry, I have no problems giving you very specific instructions to get to the next stage. If your googling keeps popping up Bandit walkthroughs instead of references, use the search operator -"bandit" to clean up the search results.

Good luck!!!!
