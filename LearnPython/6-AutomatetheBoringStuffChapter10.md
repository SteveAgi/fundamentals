# Automate the Boring Stuff Chapter 10
Similar to the previous assignment, complete the project for Chapter 10 in the book Automate the Boring Stuff using Python 3. 

<https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter10/>

This assignment will teach you how to manipulate files in a directory and does a good job of showing how complicated things can be simplified with Python. 

When you are done, submit a link to a Github repo that contains the project. I don't expect this to be easy, so ask questions in #python, look at earlier sections of the book, and make use of Google. This is fairly difficult but you should be ready!
