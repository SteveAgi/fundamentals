Similar to the previous assignment, complete the project for Chapter 11 in the book Automate the Boring Stuff using Python 3. 

<https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter11/>

This assignment teaches an important programming concept named "debugging". As you have realized by now, code doesn't work the first time you run it, and nobody just types out a hundred lines of code, looks it over once, and then it runs perfectly the first try. People write in chunks and use debugging and logging to ensure the code is staying on the rails, and to figure out what is going on when it doesn't.

When you are done, submit a link to a Github repo that contains the project. I don't expect this to be easy, so ask questions in #python, look at earlier sections of the book, and make use of Google. This is fairly difficult but you should be ready!
