# Automate the Boring Stuff Chapter 12
Similar to the previous assignment, complete the project for Chapter 12 in the book Automate the Boring Stuff using Python 3. 

<https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter12/>

This assignment is very similar to the capstone project, so I recommend you do a good job on it, as you will continue to build on this in the future. Just because code works once does not mean that it is ready for anything, so future proof your work by writing good code. 

When you are done, submit a link to a Github repo that contains the project. I don't expect this to be easy, so ask questions in #python, look at earlier sections of the book, and make use of Google. This is fairly difficult but you should be ready!
