# Purchase the Guided Version
<p> You are currently viewing the free version of our flagship course. </p>

<p> This course is free, and will always be free. I designed it so that novices can work through it by themselves with a minimal amount of direction.  </p>

<p> However, when you pay for the guided version of this course you are paying for accountability and access to the instructor, not for the course material. When you and I have skin in the game, things go better for all of us. The instructor led class guarantees I am able to get to know you and work with you personally, which I just can't do with everyone in the free course. </p>

<p> P.S. For now you get 75% off the one time price of $200 dollars with the code "accountability". </p>
