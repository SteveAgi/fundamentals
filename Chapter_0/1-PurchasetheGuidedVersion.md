# Purchase the Guided Version
<p> You are currently viewing the free version of our flagship course. </p>

<p> This course is free, and will always be free. I designed it so that anyone can work through it by themselves with a minimal amount of direction. </p>

<p> I added a paid version of the course so that I can provide individual instruction to those who want pay for it. When you purchase the guided version of this course you are paying for accountability and access to the instructor, not for the course material. When the student and teacher have skin in the game things go better for everyone. The instructor led class guarantees I am able to get to know you and work with you personally, which I just can't do with everyone in the free course. </p>
