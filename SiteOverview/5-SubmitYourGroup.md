# Submit Your Group

Earlier I asked you to find fellow students to work with for
accountability throughout this course. You don't need to know them well
now, but hopefully by the end of this you will be friends and have
learned a ton together.Â 

I recommend you make yourselves a group chat to start talking to each
other in, as well as ask questions and get your assignments reviewed.

Submit the names of the three (or more!) partners you have found for
this course. The more the merrier!

If you want to work by yourself (and I respect that) just submit the
text "I promise I will ask for help when I need it and not stop when it
gets difficult". If you ever want to find yourself a group, the option
is always open.
