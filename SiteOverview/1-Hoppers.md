This curriculum was initially built for my old school's competitive
Cyber Security Team.

I wound up naming the site after Grace Hopper because she is our
favorite person in computing history. You might have heard of her
before, but if not, <a

awesome person.

Have you ever heard the quote, "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it
is to get permission."? That was her.

That quote comes from an interview in the July 1986 CHIP's Ahoy
Magazine, the Navy's Information Technology Magazine. If you want to
read the full interview check

then and it is a testament to her vision how well this interview stands
the test of time. Her passion for knowledge and innovation is the most
important thing you can carry with you.
