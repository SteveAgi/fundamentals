This site is designed around a series of ideas that we think will make
your experience as a learner as positive as possible.

1.  No initial expectation of knowledge
2.  Everyone moves at their own pace
3.  Understanding foundational theory comes before building technical
    skills
4.  Developing fundamental technical skills lays the groundwork for
    success in any topic
5.  Knowledge must be actionable
6.  The measure of a community is how they treat those who are trying to
    gain entry
7.  There is no such thing as being done learning

Anytime something on this site doesn't seem to be matching up with our
core tenets, let me know so I can fix it. We made as many possible
mechanisms for you to help us improve our approach, the content, and the
community of this site as possible. This site is a living entity and
changes on a regular basis so that we can improve your experience.

# So What is ROP?

All you need to know right now is that ROP is an advanced exploitation
technique which beats advanced defenses by chaining together the code
which was already in a program. That definition is good enough for now,
the critical bit to understand is that you take snippets of existing
code, chain it back together in a new order, and then use those to jump
to where you need to go next. As you go through this course you will do
the same thing, gathering and rearranging information and skills you've
already learned to jump to new locations.

Nothing in this course is spoonfed, and while we try to give you good
resources, there are multiple parts in the course where we tell you to
go find out how to do something with Google. We do this when we know
there are plenty of high quality resources out there for you to learn
from and we want you to become comfortable accomplishing difficult tasks
with no direction other than a couple searchterms.

## Content

This curriculum was created based on inputs from members of my old team
and various guides scattered throughout the internet on how to break
into information security. I put this curriculum together by aggregating
all of the guides and tutorials I could find, identified what I thought
was important and added my own commentary. To say that this is built on
the backs of a hundred other people's work would be an understatement,
and I am forever grateful to be part of a community which has created so
many amazing resources. All attempts to cite source material have been
made, if there is anything I have not properly attributed, let me know.
Despite having been in the works for the last four years, this is only
the second iteration of the curriculum and it changes drastically as I
see what does and doesn't work. The only way I learn the difference is
feedback from viewers like you, so critique away.
