This curriculum was initially built for my old school's competitive Cyber Security Team.

I wound up naming the site after Grace Hopper because she is our favorite person in computing history. You might have heard of her before, but if not, [click here](https://news.yale.edu/2017/02/10/grace-murray-hopper-1906-1992-legacy-innovation-and-service) to learn about a pretty awesome person.

Have you ever heard the quote, "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."? That was her.

That quote comes from an interview in the July 1986 CHIP's Ahoy Magazine, the Navy's Information Technology Magazine. If you want to read the full interview check [this out](http://www.doncio.navy.mil/chips/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=3563). She was at the cutting edge then and it is a testament to her vision how well this interview stands the test of time. Her passion for knowledge and innovation is the most important thing you can carry with you.
