## Brainwashing

As we said before, hacking is a mindset, not a skillset. We are trying to cultivate that mindset, and yes, we are going to try to subtly brainwash you. We're not sorry about it. Genuine interest and drive are the two best indicators of success in this field, and we want to encourage it as much as we possibly can. How do we teach that? How do we measure that? We don't know. If we were pretentious losers we might say we're trying to hack your brain into becoming a hacker. But we're not. So lets call it brainwashing. Are you okay with being brainwashed?*


\* Note: This probably is not legally binding.


## Continuous Learning

The content is difficult, the scope of what there is to learn is tremendous, and the rate of innovation and change in this space makes keeping up  impossible. If you are thinking right now that you'll never learn everything; you're right! There is an infinite amount to learn, so choose the stuff that interests you and learn that.

For the rest of your time computering, you should maintain lists for things that interest you. These are just a few I recommend, I'm sure you'll think of more.

* Things you want to learn how to do
* Things you want to learn more about
* Things you want to make
* Potential future reading material
* Links to things you want to remember

I also recommend you create study material as you go, so when you finish a topic you can go back later and refresh your knowledge.

Keep track of these things and when you get tired of learning one thing, bounce back over to your lists and see what you do want to learn about. By bouncing between topics you can structure your procrastination towards your long term goals.
