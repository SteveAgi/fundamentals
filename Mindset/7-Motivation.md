# Motivation
Making goals is easy, what is hard is the follow through.

You have already completed setting your long term goals and hopefully started thinking about your short term goals.

If you haven't already, write down your long term and short term goals in a place you will be able to see every day. When I am surfing the internet procrastinating, it is great to have that reminder literally hanging over my head.

I've said it before and I will say it again, publicly committing to your goals really helps some people out. The more people who are following along with you, the more pressure you will have to keep improving yourself. I could have quit working on this course at any time for the first four years I was working on it, but the second I reached 10 students there was no looking back.

Alright, enough motivation and attitude and things like that, let's get to the good stuff!!
