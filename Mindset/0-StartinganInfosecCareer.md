# Starting an Infosec Career

There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of resources on the subject of starting an infosec career. Hell, [even I wrote one](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/library/breakIntoSecurity.html). 

There are even more on what it takes to be a hacker, how to get a job, what to learn, where to learn it, how to learn it....

In my opinion, if a new student is pointed at a list of resources and told they should be able to teach themselves, that is basically the same as telling them to go Google it.

There are arguments in defense of finding the answers yourself, and that is why this course does not hold your hand the entire time. What it does do is point at exactly where your next step in the journey should go and give you the best resources possible.

Because reading things makes us feel good and we learn things, if you are going to read anything, my recommendation is you read this series of essays by Lesley Carhart. <https://tisiphone.net/2015/10/12/starting-an-infosec-career-the-megamix-chapters-1-3?roppers/>.

If you want to read a second article, here is one from Daniel Miessler. <https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/?roppers>

Now reading those feels good, but listen to me, take everything that they say to heart, and don't look for any more articles on starting an infosec career. When one pops up in your browser, ignore it. When someone posts a list of resources, ignore it. As much fun as they are to read and bookmark, they won't improve your ability.

What will improve your ability is to follow this course and trust that the curriculum will result in the most efficient education possible. Once you're done with this course, read whatever you want.
