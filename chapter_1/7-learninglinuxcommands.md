# Learning Linux Commands

[Check out our free course!](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/mod/page/view.php?id=1012)

Over the next few sections you will be learning the basic commands required to operate in Linux. 

It is important to remember that there is no need to memorize... anything, at all, in this entire field, because you can always just have a series of cheat sheets and notes available to you. 

But the basics, like command line and text editing, will be used over and over again. In a best case scenario, you are now using Linux for everything and are getting a full immersed experience. Hopefully you learn it just because you are using the command line so much you don't even have to think about it. 

But if you are not immersed in the command line, expect to look up commands on a cheatsheet all the time. That is fine, and there are awesome cheatsheets out there. Not to mention, you can make your own if you wind up doing specialized tasks often. 

With that said, you'll always be faster if you have some commands memorized. Similarly, learning how to type properly leads to massive gains over time, as a second or two here or there will add up. 

I'd say, when I am doing stuff on the command line, about 70% of the time the commands are common enough for me to do off the top of my head. 20% of the time I google the command I am trying to use and try to figure out the usage and flags required. <1% of the time I will use local man pages to figure it out. (Does that make me a bad hacker?)

And then finally, ~10% of the time I google "how do I do ____ from linux command line". 

So yeah, don't worry about memorizing anything now, but know that anything shown here you will want to memorize at some point. I recommend running through some of the little study guides linked at the bottom of the course to really drive it home.
