# Linux Journey TextFu
Complete the section at this link: [https://linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com)

When you are complete with this section, decide which three commands you learned about that you expect to use the most often and a sentence describing what you would use them for. 

Sometimes when you try to submit things to this site, you will get a 403 error. This is caused by a script on the backend identifying the commands you are submitting as an attempted hacking attempt. The type of attack is known as a command injection attack, and if executed properly, can allow an attacker to compromise the webserver the site is hosted on. 

If for this question or any others you have problems with a 403 error, submit an explanation of what a command inject is and how a php based site like this one can defend itself.
