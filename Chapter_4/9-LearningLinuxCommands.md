# Learning Linux Commands
Over the next few sections you will be learning the basic commands required to operate from the terminal in Linux.

It is important to remember that there is no need to memorize... anything, at all, in this entire field, because you can always just have a series of cheat sheets and notes available to you.

But the basics, like command line and text editing, will be used over and over again. In a best case scenario, you are now using Linux for everything and are getting a fully immersed experience. If you use the command line for everything it makes it so you don't even have to think about it eventually.

No matter what, expect to look up commands on a cheatsheet all the time. That is fine, and there are awesome cheatsheets out there. Not to mention, you can make your own if you wind up doing specialized tasks often. I recommend you print one out now [likethisone](https://images.linoxide.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet-A4.pdf) and put it on your desk or tape it to the wall near you. If you don't have a printer or want to save ink, just save it to your desktop.

I'd say, when I am doing stuff on the command line, about 50% of the time the commands are common enough for me to do off the top of my head. 20% of the time I use a cheatsheet I have nearby. 20% of the time I google the command I am trying to use and try to figure out the usage and flags required. <1% of the time I will use local man pages to figure it out.

Finally, if I don't know the command, ~10% of the time I google "how do I do ____ from linux command line".

So yeah, don't worry about memorizing anything now, but know that anything in the next few chapters you will want to memorize at some point. I recommend running through some of the little study guides linked at the bottom of the course to really drive it home.
