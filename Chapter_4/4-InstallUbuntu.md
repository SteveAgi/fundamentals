# Install Ubuntu
Install the Linux operating system Ubuntu using your virtualization software of choice! 

**If you already have a VM with a Linux image on it, you don't need to download a new one just for this course. It will not change any aspect of your experience and there is no need to waste time or space.**

An image is what we refer to an Operating System when packaged into a format that can be run off of a disc, usually having a .iso extension. We can download .iso's and boot off of the disc, but it's generally easier to use a VM.

I could give you more information on what to do for this, but there are a ton of tutorials and youtube videos out there. Should be an easy google, and the information doesn't change too much. Let us know if you have any problems, but I recommend going step by step through a tutorial. This is your first challenge that we are telling you to figure it out yourself.

We always try to link to the source of things, even dank memes. It's a weird thing to care about, but the internet makes it so easy to repost images without any way of crediting the author, and they're producing content so might as well throw them a follow. 

When you're done, submit a screenshot of you running the Linux VM.

If the VM is running slowly, check out how much CPU you have allocated to it, and if the resolution is set too high. By lowering resolution and increasing CPU allocation you can really speed it up. If you are using Hyper-V, turn on "Enhanced Sessions". If you're having trouble with anything or it seems too slow, hit us up in #techsupport in Slack.
