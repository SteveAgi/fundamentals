You might have seen bits or binary or 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 before and got a little intimidated... but now it's time to double down and learn what bits are. In the process of learning bits, you will learn binary. Once you learn binary, you're a computer. Ipso facto, this is your last chance to stop before becoming a computer.

# Binary Basics

I'm going to not make my own stuff here and recommend that you use this tutorial, it is fantastic and SparkFun is a great company.

Work through this tutorial: <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/binary>

Once you are done with that you're ready for what comes next. You definitely don't need to memorize binary/ASCII (or any other) conversions, just use a cheatsheet like this one: [Character Conversion Cheatsheet](https://catonmat.net/ascii-cheat-sheet). 

Remember, you don't need to memorize any of this stuff. If you are at a computer, you have access to the resources you need to just look it up every time.

# Assignment 

   0. What is ASCII?
   1. What is binary? 
   2. How many bits are used for each character in ASCII?
   3. "01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001" is in binary. Convert it back to ASCII. Do it by hand using the chart.
