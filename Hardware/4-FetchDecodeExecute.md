# Fetch, Decode, Execute

## Well, we learned what these nand gates and xor is in the last section ... sort of.

To oversimplify things, because we can build any amount of logic with
them if we arrange it properly, we can start building more and more
complicated things, like an entire CPU. We'll handwave the steps in
between nand gates and a CPU (I wrote all the code for that once, it was
miserable and I didn't learn anything useful, so I'll spare you the
details) so let's just jump to the idea that CPUs exist and we want to
know how they run programs.

You might have heard of the fetch-decode-execute cycle before, which is
the basic operation of a CPU. Here is a solid video that will be a
placeholder for me before I make a video on the cycle.

This part is very complicated and likely will take some thought and
maybe drawing a diagram for yourself. Don't be afraid to google for more
resources.

Assignment:

1.  Describe the fetch-decode-execute cycle in words, explaining what
    all components and registers are doing. Keep it short, but include
    all the detail needed for you to draw it out and explain to someone.

Ensure to include Pre-Questions and Post-Questions in the usual form.
