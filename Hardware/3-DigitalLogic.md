The coolest part of digital logic is that starting from the absolute smallest pieces of circuitry we are able to build anything. From a single gate, we can build complex logic, and from that complex logic, we can structure them together to create the ability to process programs. This is the fundamentals basis of computing.

Skim these for a better appreciation... but don't read the whole thing. They're just too long. Just read enough to answer these questions.  This is literally entire fields of science and engineering. We get to be abstracted away from them, so let's not worry too much beyond trivia.
