   * Virtual Memory
    * On Windows, check to see how much RAM you are using with your virtual machine. Google how to do this.
    * Check to see how much RAM is being used by your VM and what the CPU utilization looks like. Google again.
    * Increase RAM allocated to Virtual Machine.... Yep.
    * Check back on your VM to see CPU utilization.
    * Decrease VM RAM to whatever is necessary. Now you can use this whenever you want to prioritize the speed of processing in your VM. Just bump your VM RAM, run your process, then reallocate back to Windows once it is complete. Boom, you are basically an operating system now.
