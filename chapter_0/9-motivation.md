Making goals is easy, what is hard is the follow through. 

You have already completed setting your long term goals: [Verbalizing your Desired End State]($@ASSIGNVIEWBYID*1014@$). 

And in the last section you set your short term goals of how you will accomplish them: [Short Term Goals]($@ASSIGNVIEWBYID*1001@$). 

If you haven't already, write down your long term and short term goals in a place you will be able to see every day. When I am surfing the internet procrastinating, it is great to have that reminder literally hanging over my head.

I've said it before and I will say it again, publically commit to your goals. The more people who are following along with you, the more pressure you will have to keep improving yourself. I could have quit working on this course at any time for the first four years I was working on it, but the second I reached 10 students there was no looking back.

If you already have posted about your goals, good for you, but reaffirmation or providing updates is a critical part of maintaining motivation.
