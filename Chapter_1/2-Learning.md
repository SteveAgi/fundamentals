# Learning
We all want to better at learning... but how do we do that? 

It is essential to realize that there are no shortcuts. Nobody is really born an expert at anything, it all comes down to sustained hard work, directed at the right problems. Watching videos is not hard work. Reading books is not hard work. Following tutorials is not hard work. 

Those are hard truths, but you will never improve if you find yourself in a passive role while learning. You might "learn" some vocab words, but the way things fit together will never click. 

This course is designed to force you to work. It provides a resource or two (and sometimes just search terms) and tells you to go figure it out and return when you have the answer. What sets this course apart from every other resource to learn security on the internet is that once you finish a task, you now have a clearly defined next step. And a step after that. And a hundred more steps after that. And if at any point you get lost, or confused, or just need more motivation, there are mentors and other people taking the course  available to help.

While we're on this, I'm going to let you in on one more dirty secret. It is impossible to be an expert in all aspects of cybersecurity. Even the best people in one dark corner are total noobs in another. And that is fine, and is totally expected. There's too much out there to learn it all. 

At the end of this course you will have learned enough to decide what you want to specialize in, at least for a bit, so that you can learn the skills you need to get a job in that specific skillset. That is when it is time to start talking about mastery. 

Read this, it is a wonderful intro to the psychology of learning and where you are as a student <https://azeria-labs.com/the-process-of-mastering-a-skill/>.

As you go through this course we will introduce you to other learning techniques, but to sum it all up: take notes, look back over the material regularly, and understand that the only thing that actually will contribute to future success is putting the time in now.

The most important thing to realize while you are on this journey is that you will never know everything, because nobody knows everything. All you can do is keep working at things and eventually, you will start understanding more because you have a strong foundation to build on. We are here to help you build that foundation.
