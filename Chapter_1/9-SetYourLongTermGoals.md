# Set Your Long Term Goals
The most important thing for you to increase your chances of success are to decide on, verbalize, and record your goals and the things you are doing to attain them. 

I am assuming that you are taking this course so that you can better at security fundamentals. The extension of that is that you want to be a cyber security professional and that this is the first step of a long and exciting career. 

To flesh those ideas out, put some time into your goals. 

1. What are your long term goals in the fields of security and computing?
2. Do you intend on making this a career? 
3. What are your goals for taking this course? 

If you don't know yet, or don't feel comfortable submitting them yet, totally cool.  You can move on and come back to this whenever you want.
