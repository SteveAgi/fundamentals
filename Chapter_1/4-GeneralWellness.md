#### Coronavirus
   * You are likely working from home right now and should be practicing social distancing
   * For a great unofficial guide, check out <https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/dont-panic-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-guide-to-the-coronavirus/>
   * For the official .gov website, visit: <https://www.coronavirus.gov/>

#### Hydrate Constantly
   * My life motto is "Stay Happy and Stay Hydrated", and it is inscribed in my class ring... so yeah, I take hydration seriously
   * You should be going to the bathroom every 2-4 hours
   * Caffeine, and especially drinks like coffee and energy drinks dehydrate you 
   * Hydration is slightly more complicated than water in/water out. Electrolytes are what actually provide hydration, so you basically can't go wrong adding extra electrolytes to your water. Pre-made powders are expensive, so you can make your own with 2-1 sugar/salt ratio and mix into water. 

#### Sleep
   * Everyone loves bragging about being a hardo and sleeping four hours a night for months on end... guess what? It's not just stupid, it's actively hurting you in a variety of ways

#### Nutrition
   * I'm not going to make you read anything, just don't eat cheetos and hot pockets and drink Monsters as your only sustenance for the day. Order in some Chinese or Thai. Not every delivery meal has to be pizza. 
   * Cook your own food every once in a while/everday. Instant ramen doesn't count. Cooking is fun as hell. Do it. 

#### Fitness
   * Not going to beat this one to death. Getting your heart rate elevated for a few minutes a day is good for you, full stop. Do it. 
   * This is a pretty solid article. <https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/a-15-minute-daily-walk-will-help-you-live-longer-says-study/>. I really like it because it does a great job of explaining the science and the study behind the results. As hackers, we care about methodology, and are always looking for people to "prove it". 

####  Neurodiversity
   * Hackers are known for our neurodiversity, and our brains let us do amazing things, but sometimes they work in ways that don't always make the most sense to us and the people around us. Here are some resources to help understand what you or other people experience every day.

#### Mental Health
   * The more you know about these concerns and their symptoms, the better you can understand them. Additionally, everyone needs more general suicide prevention and depression training. It's not fun, but it is worth having all the resources you can. Read all of these. Help yourself or help your friends.
