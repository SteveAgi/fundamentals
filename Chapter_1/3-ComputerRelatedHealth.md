# Computer Related Health
If you're going to be working through this course, competing in a CTF, or binging Netflix, these are a few changes you can constantly put into practice that will make you a happier and healthier person.

1. Now fix your setup so that everything aligns properly. This is an investment. If you have a laptop, find a keyboard and mouse and set the laptop up on top of books to get it to the right height when you are sitting down. Try to avoid having a laptop on your lap, get it on a table and sit in a chair. 

## Blue Light and Brightness
* Drop the brightness on your computer as far as you can. Just trust me.
* Are you used to your eyes hurting after too long on the computer? This is mostly from the blue light. There's a ton of research you can read to prove it, or you can download this and it will change your life. <https://justgetflux.com/>
   * Windows has this option by default now, so check for that before downloading flux.
* It is also an option to get blue light filtering glasses if you have money to blow. You should buy a pair from <https://www.blenderseyewear.com/collections/blue-light>. I'm not sponsored, but I used to live next to them and they're chill guys and gals so they deserve money. 
   * If we're being honest, you can get cheap pairs from Amazon and they'll be like 1/5 the price and do basically the same thing. 

## Dark Mode
I'm sorry, but I'm a terrible web developer. HTML and CSS are hard. Despite everyone asking for a dark mode, I can't implement one with my current skillset. Soo, my response is to tell you to install a dark mode extension for your browser if you want dark modes. I use <https://mybrowseraddon.com/dark-mode.html>. It doesn't work great for Roppers, but it is easier on the eyes. I recommend you use option "blue dark", 10 down on class A of general dark styles. Hopefully y'all aren't here for my web design skills.
