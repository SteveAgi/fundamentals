# Secure Yourself Now
You signed up for this course to improve yourself, to learn how to secure yourself online, and to help others. That's what this section is dedicated to. If you finish this section and don't do anything else, your participation in this course will be a success in my eyes. 

Of course, I would prefer you to continue in the course, but I'm glad you are here, and I hope you stick around. 

If you have experience in this field you might know everything I am about to tell you, but I'm going to tell you it again. If you have strong opinions on things like this, you might not like that my advice defaults to a Windows OS and using Chrome. I don't have strong opinions, but they have the most market share and I am writing this for a very broad audience. 

My first recommendation is to start using a password manager.  Read this <https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/> to learn about password managers, and then install one, I  recommend <https://lastpass.com/>. There's plenty of other great password managers out there, but I've been using this one forever and that is the only reason I recommend it. Convince your friends and family to use password managers. If you don't want to do this now, skip it. If you don't like trusting random internet people who tell you to download things in the first 5 minutes they know you, good call. I respect that. 

Your second task, if you do not already have one installed, is to install an ad-blocking extension. Ad-blockers do what they say they do, making your web experience significantly better, but also block trackers and lessen the chance of getting malware laden ads.  For Chrome, I recommend uBlock Origin: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en>. I don't use Firefox, but it has an ad-blocker built in which makes it one of the best choices for the privacy and security conscious. I also recommend installing Chrome and ad-blockers (or Firefox) on as many computers of friends and family that you do tech support for. If you don't want to do this now, skip it. 

You always like to think you don't already have malware on your computer but if you are working off of a shared family computer, there's a decent chance if you haven't checked recently. First, ensure that Windows Defender is enabled. If it isn't, turn it on. After you've done that, turn on automatic updates and ensure your computer is completely updated. If it isn't, update now. Once again, do this on as many computers as you are responsible for. If you're not on Windows, I don't really recommend adding 3rd party antivirus solutions, so the best I can tell you is to avoid installing sketchy programs. 

While this stuff might seem obvious, doing the fundamentals will make you significantly more secure than the average internet citizen. We're not trying to turn you into a cyber warlord yet, we'll start with being a hard target and generally informed.
