# Long Term Review and Retention
Long term knowledge theory combined with you can't possibly remember this all

For this chapter, you should memorize anything I put into these cards. Don't actually worry about knowing trhem now, just trust the Anki process.

For everything else, take notes using your second brain. 

Now whenever you have to think about this material, you will have strong memories of what you did and what you know, as well as have a record of where your second brain material is. 

If you want to make your own decks, you can, but don't go overboard and spend your time making decks. Only use these if you feel like you have other material you want to retain. Once you've added these questions and answers, add them with a pull request to this repository so I can add them to the master repo.
