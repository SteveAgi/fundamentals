If you are a representative of a company or organization who is
interested in sponsoring this site, check out
<https://www.hoppersroppers.org/sponsors.html> for more information. I
see corporate sponsorship as the way forward for me to able to work on
this site forever. 

If you are an individual who wants to support this mission, check out
our Gumroad where you can make one-time or recurring donations.

Overall, the best way for you to help out Roppers, and by extension me,
is to share this site with as many people who are trying to enter the
field as possible. My goal is for this to become known as the best place
on the internet to start, and that can only happen with the support of
students like you loving this course, learning a ton, and then sharing
it with your friends and networks.
