Right now, I'm not expecting you to have any prior knowledge. If you do, some of the stuff here might be a bit basic, but I guarantee even an expert can learn a bit from each section. If you're brand new to this stuff, expect to learn an incredible amount. 

# Your First Assignment

In this course I like to have students submit short written assignments. As I cannot grade all of the assignments for the free courses, they are really for you to use to self-assess your understanding. I have a specific format that I want you to fill out for each assignment, which will force you to think through what you are doing.

First, there will be the questions I want you to answer. 
For example:

```
Questions:

1. What is an operating system?
2. Describe what an operating system is responsible for. 
   * (This is a trick question, it's everything.)
3. What is the world's most popular operating system? 
4. What are the top desktop operating systems?

Resources:

1. The previous section
2. Google

```

For each of the questions I ask, I expect you to answer them with a sentence or two that will be enough for you to understand what you meant in the future when you study them. Every time you write up an assignment, treat it like you are making study material for future you, or someone you are trying to teach.

Sometimes I will give you references, oftentimes I will make you Google for the resources yourself. Learning to pick out and use trusted resources is a major skill to learn. In this case, I gave you the resource.

Looking at Wikipedia, there is a ton of information there, and each sentence has linked resources. In order to understand what is going on, you might have to go one level deeper to feel like you have a grasp of your answers. Please, don't get too deep into the rabbit-hole, just learn enough that you can answer the question and move on. Despite the Wikipedia page having information on the history and formatting and more of man-pages, stick to what you need to answer these questions and move on.

Let's demo how I want you to try and do this going forward. Don't worry about things like plagiarism, though feel free to rewrite things however you want if it helps you understand better.

As you try to answer the first list of questions, and start writing out answers you probably will find yourself unsure of what some of the words mean that are used on the page. Write down what questions you have you feel like you need to answer before you can confidently answer the actual questions.  I don't want you to read through the entire page (there is no reason to and you won't get anything out of it), but skim / ctfl-f for what is required to understand the answers to the initial questions I asked.There is no need to write out things you already know, just things that are new.

```
Pre-Questions:

* What is 'Unix-like'?
* What is POSIX?

```

To answer these questions, you would use Google and work through each of these questions until you were satisfied with the answer. As an important note, you can rabbit hole very deep trying to answer many of these questions. I strongly recommend (basically beg you) to never go deeper than one level away from the questions I ask.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7W2I9FGF9U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For example, following the things you do not understand too many levels deep could wind up looking like this:

```
Pre-Questions:

* What is 'Unix-like'?
* What is POSIX?
      * Why do we need standards for computing?
         * What authority do they have to make them?
            * Why do we follow the law?
               * How do I start my own anarchist commune?
                  * What are the optimal conditions for growing tomatoes?
```
And so on.

You don't want to play that game. Go one level deep (i.e, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3... ) and answer those questions. If you still do not understand your answers at that first level down, write what you do not get and move on (unless you absolutely feel like you have to answer it). Trust me, you can get away with not knowing everything. This course is meant to fill in  all the gaps eventually. 

Instead of writing out answers to your second level questions at 1.2.1, move them into the Post-Questions section and don't worry about answering them. That is my job as your teacher. 



As mentioned above, any new questions we have but are not going to answer, either because we don't need it to understand our answers or because they are too deep, we will put here.

```
Post-Questions:

* How different are Macs from Linux?
```

Finally, I want your unfiltered, raw feedback, telling me exactly how you feel about this section.

```
Feedback:

Put it here and help me improve the material!

```


## Final Format

To bring all of this together, the assignment you receive will look like this:

~~~
 Questions:

1. What is an operating system?
2. Describe what an operating system is responsible for. 
   * (This is a trick question, it's everything.)
3. What is the world's most popular operating system? 
4. What are the top desktop operating systems?


 Resources:

 * Previous Section

~~~

I expect you to answer with a text file that looks like this:


~~~
 Pre-Questions:

 * What is 'Unix-like'?
  * Unix-like means an operating system based off of the Unix OS. 
 * What is POSIX? 
  * POSIX stands for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) and is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. This is the Linux standard.

Answers:

1.
2. 
3.
4. 

 Resources:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX

 Post-Questions:

* How does the kernel work?
* How different are Macs from Linux?

 Feedback:
Most of this material made sense (except for the kernel diagram) but I don't understand this weird format. I sure hope you have some sort of master plan for this.

~~~

For your first assignment, submit the text of the answer I provided above (but make sure to fill in the answers!) Feel free to add any Pre-Questions or Post-Questions if you have any.

 Note the feedback I gave myself. Despite this being meant to be straightforward, sections of it are too advanced for where we are right now, and that is perfectly okay. Make sure to give honest feedback about how you feel about the different assignments.
